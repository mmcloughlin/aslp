  (* To change this, you'd need to know :
      - The condition under which its safe to copy prop
      - The current reachability

     If you can't establish you are guarded, implies you need to introduce a branch.
     The branch will have the outcomes of both exp reduction and maintaining the current temp.
     Then need to specialise everything downstream for this point based on this introduced branch.

     This means you need to pull the condition out to the front.
     Which means its needs to be fully reduced and in terms of enc.
     BDD approach gives us this flexibility, every single condition in the program in terms of original enc.
     Relatively simple to reduce from that point: eliminate guards based on reachability, etc.

     You can implement constant-prop and dead code in a similar fashion, as long as your notions of conditional
     use / redefinition / loss of constant precision is purely in terms of the original enc.

  (* To change this, you'd need to know :
      - The condition under which its safe to copy prop
      - The current reachability

     If you can't establish you are guarded, implies you need to introduce a branch.
     The branch will have the outcomes of both exp reduction and maintaining the current temp.
     Then need to specialise everything downstream for this point based on this introduced branch.

     This means you need to pull the condition out to the front.
     Which means its needs to be fully reduced and in terms of enc.
     BDD approach gives us this flexibility, every single condition in the program in terms of original enc.
     Relatively simple to reduce from that point: eliminate guards based on reachability, etc.

     You can implement constant-prop and dead code in a similar fashion, as long as your notions of conditional
     use / redefinition / loss of constant precision is purely in terms of the original enc.

statement s is the only definition of x reaching u on every path from s to u there are no assignments to y
